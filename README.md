# sql_mavenmovies

This is part of my sql practice. The sql set-up can be done by importing the create_mavenmovies.sql. If you are a beginner and want to dip your toes in, then first start with sql_first2_chapters.log file, there are some questions and answers present to start things off. Then move to the questions.txt file which contains the questions for more practice.

Here's an unexpected thing which I did during my sql practice. I saw the questions were being discussed in the video and I was not able to read all of them at the same time. So I thought why not just write a python script to get these questions for me into a text file, so I wrote the extractText.py to get the questions.txt file from the png files present in this folder.
